## Hardware

I use a laptop (Thinkpad X1 Carbon 6th Generation) and desktop. The laptop is 14-inches and has 16GB of RAM and an i7-8650 processor. The desktop that I use has an i7-7700k and 32Gb of RAM. For my phone I use an iphone 11 and for listening I use M6 pros.

### Terminal
My terminal of choice is the [st](https://st.suckless.org/), with the following patches.

[st-anysize](https://st.suckless.org/patches/anysize/)
[st-appsync](https://st.suckless.org/patches/sync/)
[st-autosync](https://st.suckless.org/patches/sync/)
[st-boxdraw_v2](https://st.suckless.org/patches/boxdraw/)
[st-ligature-boxdraw](https://st.suckless.org/patches/ligatures/)

### Window Manager
I use [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) as the window manager of choice. I do not use a bar with it and use dunst as a notification manager. Most of my other software are [suckless](https://suckless.org) utilities.
